# Controlled Forms in React - Form State as a Single Object

## Time for a refactor
At this point, your App component should look like this: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('The full name will appear here.');
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  const handleFirstNameChange = (event) => {
    setFirstName(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleLastNameChange = (event) => {
    setLastName(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name: </label>
        <input
          id="firstName"
          value={firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="lastName">Last Name: </label>
        <input id="lastName" value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </form>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You may have noticed that the code to manage this form state is repetitive. Imagine what the `App` component would look like if our form had even more inputs. With this method, each would need its own state and its own event handler. 

To streamline our code, we can refactor how we manage our state. Instead of having separate state items for each input, like `firstName` and `lastName`, we can consolidate them into a single state object. This approach also allows us to create a more versatile function that can be used for multiple input fields. 

First, let's change our state to the following: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  const [title, setTitle] = useState('The full name will appear here.');
  // Replace the firstName and lastName state variables with the following:
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
  });
```

Note that the event handler functions are causing errors now. That's okay, and we'll refactor them soon. There's nothing special about the `formData` name we've chosen for state; it's just the name of our state variable. 

We now have an object that can hold state for both inputs. Update the `value` of each input to reflect our new state variable. We'll also add a `name` attribute to our inputs. We'll need this value in the next step: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <form>
        <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name: </label>
        <input
          id="firstName"
          name="firstName"
          value={formData.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="lastName">Last Name: </label>
        <input
          id="lastName"
          name="lastName"
          value={formData.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </form>
```

With our form inputs refactored, let's also refactor our handler functions into a single function that can be passed to both inputs: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  // Remove this function:
  const handleFirstNameChange = (event) => {
    setFirstName(event.target.value);
  };

  // Remove this function:
  const handleLastNameChange = (event) => {
    setLastName(event.target.value);
  };

  // Replace them with the following:
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };
```

That might look strange. We'll talk about what's happening in this code in a moment, but first, let's get this to a state where it's working. 

Change the inputs to use the new handler function:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <form>
        <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name: </label>
        <input
          id="firstName"
          name="firstName"
          value={formData.firstName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="lastName">Last Name: </label>
        <input
          id="lastName"
          name="lastName"
          value={formData.lastName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </form>
```

### Setting `formData`
Back to the `handleChange()` function: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };
```

**Note**: A couple of interesting things are happening here: 
1. We use the spread operator to copy any values from the original state into the new object used to construct the new state. This way, when updating the `firstName` state, we don't lose the `lastName` state and vice versa!
2. `event.target.name` takes the value of the name prop in our input form. We're able to access the key dynamically through the use of square bracket notation. 

Let's break down the second point even further. 
![breaking down square bracket notation](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/controlled-forms-in-react/form-state-as-a-single-object/assets/handle-change.png)
1. This is the `formData` state. The `firstName` property is highlighted.
2. The `<input>` element. The valye of the `name` prop aligns with the `firstName` property in the `formData` state. The `formData.firstName` state is used as the value of the input. 
3. When a user changes the data in this input, the `[event.target.name]: event.target.value` code is executed. The value of the `<input>` element's `name` prop (`firstName`) is set as a ket on the new `formData` state and had a value matching the new value. 
4. This is the result of the above, assuming the has typed `Alex` into the `<input name='firstName'>` element. 

Typing the name 'Sam' into the first name input would result in an event handler that is computed as the following: 

```
// first letter typed ("S")
setFormData({ ...formData, firstName: 'S' })
// second letter typed ("a")
setFormData({ ...formData, firstName: 'Sa' })
// third letter typed ("m")
setFormData({ ...formData, firstName: 'Sam' })

// With our state looking like this afterward:
{
  firstName: 'Sam',
  lastName: ''
}
```

Order is important. Note the code to set our state: 

```
setFormData({ ...formData, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
```

This pattern works to update the state because the existing `formData` state is spread into the `setFormData()` function ***first***, and then the new data to update that existing state comes after it. 

Going back to the example above, where the user has typed the first letter (`"s"`) of the name "Sam", the new state to be set is computed as the following: 

```
setFormData({
  firstName: '', // first instance of firstName
  lastName: '',
  firstName: 'S', // second instance of firstName
})
```

Because there is a duplicate `firstName` property, the first one is discarded, leaving only the second - the one with the new value for `firstsName`. If the setter is reversed: 

```
setFormData({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value, ...formData });
```

The new state would be computed as the following: 

```
setFormData({
  firstName: 'S', // first instance of firstName
  firstName: '', //second instance of firstName 
  lastName: '',
})
```

Again, the first instance of `firstName` would be discarded, leaving only the existing `firstName` state. 

Finally, note that because we are spreading all of our existing state into the new state object, we don't lose the `firstName` property's value even when we call the handler from our last name input: 

```
// First letter typed ("V")
setFormData({ ...formData, lastName: 'V' })
// Second letter typed("o")
setFormData({ ...formData, lastName: 'o' })

// Updated state:
{
  firstName: 'Sam',
  lastName: 'Vo'
}
```

As a result of this dynamic behavior, we can use this one function in both of our `onChange` handlers~

There's a lot going on in this event handler, and it might feel intimidating at first. However, there is good news - this code is highly reusable. 

> Repeatable Pattern: For forms with text-based inputs, this exact `handleChange()` function can be used to manage form state - given that your state and elements are set up in a specific way. 
> If your form state is set up like this: 
```
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  // a property should exist for every named input in the form
});
```
> And if the inputs in your form have `name` props, then you can use this same `handleChange` function:
```
const handleChange = (event) => {
  setFormData({ ...formData, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
};
```
> as the `onChange` handler for every text-based input form.
