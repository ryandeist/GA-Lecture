# React JWT Auth Template - Conditionally Render in a Route

## Authenticating requests with a JWT
Let's make the `Dashboard` component useful by fetching some data from the server. We'll need to authenticate this request with a JWT. This is because the server will only respond with the data if the request includes a valid token. The server will not respond with the requested data without the token. 

## Fetching data from the server
Let's start by creating a new service function that fetches the data we need. This function will make the authenticated request for user data to the server. 

The function shouldn't go in the `authService.js` file because while the request needs to be authenticated, the request itself isn't related to authentication. Instead, we'll create a new file that will contain all of our service functions for fetching user data: 

```
touch src/services/userService.js
```

## `userService.js`
Create a new service function called `index()` in `userService.js` that makes a GET request to `/users`to fetch user data from the server. The function should:
* Include a `try...catch` block to handle any errors that occur during the request.
* Use the `fetch()` API to make the request. 
* Use a `BASE_URL` variable to build the URL for the request - this variable doesn't exist in this file yet, so you'll need to create it and assign it the appropriate value - there's an example of this in the `authService.js` file - but it won't match exactly. 
* Implement error handling by checking the data returned from the server, similar to what we implemented in the `signIn()` and `signUp()` functions in `authService.js`
    * if there is an `error` property on the data returned from the server, we know there was an error(this is assigned in the back-end code).
    * if there isn't an `error` property, we'll assume the request was successful. Return the data to the function.
* Export the function

Move to the `Dashboard` component file
* Import the function in the `Dashboard` component
* Import the `useEffect()` hook from React.
* Write a `useEffect()` hook that containss a function named `fetchUsers()`. This function should: 
    * Include a `try...catch` block to handle any errors that occurred during the request. If there is an error, log it to the console. 
    * In the `try` block, call the `index()` function from the `userService` file. Store the data returned from the function in a variable named `fetchedUsers`.
    * Console log the `fetchedUsers` variable.
* From within the `useEffect()` hook, call the `fetchUsers()` function if there is a `user`
* Add the `user` context to the dependency array of the `useEffect()` hook.

### Test
Return to your browser, open the console, and navigate to the dashboard while logged in. If youâ€™ve set everything up correctly, you should seeâ€¦ an error. Thatâ€™s ok though; the error message should indicate that the token is invalid and youâ€™re unauthorized to access that route on the server. Weâ€™ll fix that next!

> ðŸ˜Ž Having trouble with this? Thatâ€™s ok, a lot is going on here! Try debugging any problems you have, but if you need it, there is a solution below.

### Solution
First - the `userService.js` file:

```jsx
// src/services/userService.js

const BASE_URL = `${import.meta.env.VITE_BACK_END_SERVER_URL}/users`;

const index = async () => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(BASE_URL);

    const data = await res.json();

    if (data.err) {
      throw new Error(data.err);
    }

    return data
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw new Error(err);
  }
};


export {
  index,
};
```

Next, the dashboard component: 

```jsx
// src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx

import { useEffect, useContext } from 'react';

import { UserContext } from '../../contexts/UserContext';

import * as userService from '../../services/userService';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const { user } = useContext(UserContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUsers = async () => {
      try {
        const fetchedUsers = await userService.index();
        console.log(fetchedUsers);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
      }
    }
    if (user) fetchUsers();
  }, [user]);

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.username}</h1>
      <p>
        This is the dashboard page where you can see a list of all the users.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;
```

### Making an authenticated request
Let's fix the unauthorized error we're seeing in the console.

To do this, we need to include the JWT in the request to the server so that it knows who we are. We'll do this by adding an `Authorization` header to the request. This header will contain the word `Bearer` along with the JWT.

```jsx
// src/services/userService.js

const index = async () => {
  try {
    // Change the fetch request so that it includes the Authorization header
    const res = await fetch(BASE_URL, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}` },
    });

    const data = await res.json();

    if (data.err) {
      throw new Error(data.err);
    }

    return data
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw new Error(err);
  }
};
```

Note the formatting of the Authorization header: `Bearer` followed by a space and then the token. This exact format is required, and our back-end server will expect it. 

Try navigating to the dashboard again. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the returned from the server logged to the console.

## Displaying the data in our app.
All thatâ€™s left to do is put that data into state and display it! Tackle this on your own. Display the data in a list that shows the username of each user.
