# Intro to React - React Ecosystem

## React Ecosystem
React boasts a large ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks that serve to expand and augment the capabilities of React. 

The React ecosystem includes:
* **React Router**: React Router is a tool for adding client-side navigation to single-page React applications. It uses URLs to dynamically update the user interface, creating the experience of a multi-page app. 
* **Build Tools**: Tools like [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) are significant players in the React ecosystem. They streamline the setup and build process and allow developers to focus on code rather than an apps configuration. 
> Create React App is being phased out; however, you will likely encounter code or references to CRA, as it was the predominant method for generating a React App in the past.
* **React-Native**: React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using the same principles as React.
* **React-based Frameworks**: In recent years, frameworks built on React have emerged as solutions for the perceived shortcomings of the React library. These frameworks include tools like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). They offer features like server-side rendering and static site generation, which are helpful for SEO and optimization.

Various other libraries expand on React. These libraries are accessible through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and provide helpful tools for specific use cases.
