# Fetching Data in React - Fetching Data with Service Functions

## The Fetch API
Let's get some practice using AJAX techniques in React. While there are several options for retrieving external data in React, we'll use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

The Fetch API is tool provided by modern browsers (and Node.js) that allows developers to make asynchronous HTTP requests using JavaScript. With the Fetch API's `fetch()` method, our React apps can communicate with the servers hosted elsewhere on the web.

In the lesson, we'll use the `fetch()` method to retrieve weather information from the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). When we make a request to the Weather API server, we can expect JSON data as a response. This data can then be stored in state and rendered for our users.

> The `fetch()` method is asynchronous, so we'll need to utilize `async/await` syntax when making requests.

## Service functions
When implementing the Fetch API within a React app, it's common practice to encapsulate fetching logic into dedicated modules known as *services*. These modules contain functions for making fetch requests, often grouped by the resource they are dealing with. 

For example, we might have a `src/services/bookService.js` module for a `Book` resource. Inside `src/services/bookService.js`, we could include various functions for creating, reading, updating, or deleting the `Book` resource.

When our React app needs to call upon a given service function, we can `import` it inside the appropriate component. 

The benefits of this pattern include: 
* **Modularity**: Service functions promote code resuse across an application by isolating API logic.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Service functions keep the API logic seperate from the UI logic, making our components easier to read.
* **Testing and Debugging**: Service functions make testing and debugging our code easier, making our apps more reliable.

While it is possible to write our fetching logic directly within a component, this will often make an application more difficult to maintain as it grows in complexity. 

## Creating service functions
Let's create a dedicated service module for our requests to the Weather API.

Begin by creating a `services` directory inside `src`:

```
mkdir src/services
```

Then, create the service file: 

```
touch src/services/weatherService.js
```

At the top of this file, we'll define a `BASE_URL`. This variable represents the initial part of the URL we wish to make requests to. It typically includes the protocol, domain name, and any path segments shared across the API's endpoints. 

A `BASE_URL` simplifies making requests withing different service functions that share the same starting point, as additional parameters or paths can be appened withing each function. 

Since each request to the Weather API requires our `API_KEY`, we'll incorporate this into our `BASE_URL` to avoid repetition in our service functions. 

Add the following to `src/services/weatherService.js`:

```js
// src/services/weatherService.js

const API_KEY = '<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>';
const BASE_URL = `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${API_KEY}`;
```
> Remember to replace `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual API Key!

Next, let's define an async function that will make our fetch request. 

Our function will use the `fetch()` method to make a GET request to the endpoint as speciified in our `BASE_URL`. When making this request, we'll need to include a query parameter specifying the city for which we want data. 

Add the following to `src/services/weatherService.js`:

```js
const show = async (city) => {
    try {
        const queryString = `&q=${city}`;
        const res = await fetch(BASE_URL + queryString);
        const data = await res.json();
        console.log('data:', data);
        return data;
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
};
```

In the code block above, we construct a request URL, send the request, and then parse the response as JSON. Both the `fetch()` and `json()` methods are asynchronous, so we include the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the code. 

Notice how we define the `queryString` variable on its own line and then add it to the end of the `BASE_URL`. This makes our code a bit more legible
> The `.json()` method converts the JSON formatted string from the response into a JavaScript object

Thanks to the addition of the Fetch API in Node 18, we can try our this function before implementing it in a React component.

At the botton of the file, call upon `show()`, specifying the city of your choice:

```js
show('New York');
```

Run the following command in your terminal to execute your file

```
node src/services/weatherService.js
```

If successful, you should see a response like the following in your terminal: 

```
Data: {
  location: { ... },
  current: { ... }
}
```

## Implementing services in React components
With our service function built out, we can now use it within a React component. 

First, let's be sure to `export` the function: 

```jsx
// src/services/weatherService.js

// show('New York'); <=== Remove this line!

export { show };
```

Next, add the following `import` to the top of `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import * as weatherService from './services/weatherService';
```

This syntax imports everythin (`*`) exported from the `weatherService.js` module and groups them inside a `weatherService` object. Whenever we require a specific service function, we can access it through dot notation on the `weatherService` object.

Finally, add the following to the `App` component:

```jsx
const App = () = {
    const fetchData = async () => {
        const data = await weatherService.show('Baltimore');
        console.log('Data', data);
    };

    return (
        <main>
            <h1>Weather API</h1>
            <button onClick={fetchData}>Fetch Weather Data</button>
        </main>
    );
};

export default App;
```

Here, we call upon `fetchData()` with an `onClick` event handler and log the data returned from `weatherService.show('Baltimore)` to the console. 

Try it.
