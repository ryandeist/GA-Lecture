# Lifting State in React - Lifting State

## Overview
Let's practice the concept of lifting state with a real-world example. We'll construct a to-do application in which data is passed from a child component to its parent. 

Our to-do app will consist of the following: 

![](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/lifting-state-in-react/lifting-state/assets/crd.png)

* **App (parent component)**: The main component that holds state and the child subcomponents.
* **NewTodo (child component)**: A form component for creating new to-do items.
* **TodoList (child component)**: A list component responsible for rendering the to-dos held in state. 

## Setting up `App.jsx`
We can now remove the counter functionality from `src/App.jsx`

Update `App.jsx` with the following: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

const App = () => {

  const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
    console.log(newTodo);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Check you browser and confirm that the to-do App is being rendered. 

## Creating the `NewTodo` form
In your terminal, create a new component file: 

```
touch src/components/NewTodo.jsx
```

In `src/components/NewTodo.jsx`, add the following: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

const NewTodo = (props) => {
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Creating a new to-do...");
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="todoInput">Todo: </label>
      <input id="todoInput" type="text" name="todo" />
      <button type="submit">Create to-do</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default NewTodo;
```

Now, let's import it at the top of `src/App.jsx`: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import NewTodo from './components/NewTodo.jsx';
```

Next, add the component within the `return` statement of `App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
      <NewTodo />
    </>
  );
```

Check your browser. You should now see that the form has been added to the page. 

Click the **Create to-do** button on the page and check your browser's dev tools console for the logged text "Creating a new to-do...".

## Passing `addTodo` to the `NewTodo` form
Now, we want to pass `addTodo` down from `App.jsx` to `NewTodo.jsx` om much the same way that we passed `addOne` down from `App.jsx` to `IncrementButton.jsx` previously. 

Make the following adjustment to the `return` statement of `src/App.jsx` to accomplish this: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
      <NewTodo addTodo={addTodo} />
    </>
  );
```

Now, the `addTodo` function, defined in `App.jsx`, will be available within `NewTodo.jsx` as `props.addTodo`. Let's use that within our `handleSubmit` function: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    props.addTodo('data created within NewTodo component');
  };
```

Back in the browser, click the **Create to-do** button and check the console to ensure the text "data created within NewTodo component" has been logged. The important thing here is that was logged by `addTodo` in `App.jsx`. This function was called by `handleSubmit` within `NewTodo.jsx`. There, we passed `props.addTodo` an argument of `'data created within NewTodo component'`.

## Setting up state for the `NewTodo` form
At this point, we can pass information to the parent via the `addTodo` function. However, we're only passing the string "data created within NewTodo component", which is not exciting or useful. Let's create an input so the user can enter text, which will then be passed to `props.addTodo` instead of the static text. 

At the top of `NewTodo.jsx` import `useState`, so that we can keep track of what the user has typed: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

import { useState } from 'react';
```

Now initialize the state and its setter function inside the `NewTodo` function: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
```

Update your form in `NewTodo.jsx` like so:

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="todoInput">Todo: </label>
      <input 
        id="todoInput"
        type="text"
        name="todo"
        onChange={handleChange}
        value={newTodo}
      />
      <button type="submit">Create to-do</button>
    </form>
```
![](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/lifting-state-in-react/lifting-state/assets/new-todo.png)

Finally, create the `handleChange` function, which will be called when the user types in the text input. It will invoke `setNewTodo`, passing in the value of the input that the user entered: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setNewTodo(event.target.value);
  };
```

Notice that we set the `value` attribute of the `<input>` tag to `{newTodo}`, which is being updated in the `handleChange` function as the user types. By binding the value of the input to state, which is updated as the user types, we have created a controlled input. 

Test this out in the browser by typing something into the text input. 

### Passing form state to `addTodo`
Great! Our form has its own internal state, but the test "data created within NewTodo component" is still being passed to `props.addTodo`. Let's pass the `newTodo` state variable instead~

In `NewTodo.jsx`, update your `handleSubmit` function to accomplish this: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    props.addTodo(newTodo);
  };
```

Check back in the browser. Type something into the input and click the **Create to-do** button. You should now see that the browser console has logged your input text. Yay! 

![](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/lifting-state-in-react/lifting-state/assets/lifting.png)

Let's add a new feature to improve the user experience. When we click the **Create Todo** button, the text we enteredin the `<input>` tag remains. It'd be nice if that value were cleared out so that it's easier for the user to enter additional to-do items. 

Because this is a controlled input, we can control the text in the input using the `newTodo` state variable. This means we can clear it when needed. Adjust the `handleSubmit` function like so: 

```jsx
// src/components/NewTodo.jsx
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    props.addTodo(newTodo);
    setNewTodo('');
  };
```

Now, when we click "Create to-do" the `newTodo` state variable is set to the empty string. This gets reflected in the `<input>` tag, removing any text the user had typed. 

Try using the form in the browser, and check the DevTools console. Everything you type should show up there. Congratulations! The `NewTodo` form is complete, and we've successfully lifted the data from its `newTodo` state variable up to the `App` component!
