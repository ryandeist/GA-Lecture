# Pets Back-End - Defining the Database

## Create the model file `pet.js`
While this application will not have multiple models, itâ€™s still a good idea to create a directory called models that will store all Mongoose models used in the application. Letâ€™s go ahead and create the directory, along with our `pet.js` file inside of it:

```bash
mkdir models
touch models/pet.js
```
> ðŸ’¡ We use a singular naming convention for model files, as a single file will always export just one model.

## Create the pet schema
Before weâ€™re able to define our model, we must first import the mongoose library into our `pet.js` file:

```js
// models/pet.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```

Next weâ€™ll define the schema, which provides a consistent structure to our data.

In this case, our pet model will be pretty simple, with a `name` property of type `String`, an `age` property of type `Number`, and a `breed` property of type `String`. Weâ€™ll also specify that `name` and `age` are required fields, and give `age` a minimum value of `0`.

Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll define that in our `pet.js` file:

```js
// models/pet.js

const petSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    min: 0,
    required: true,
  },
  breed: String,
});
```

## Register the model
Now that weâ€™ve defined our schema, weâ€™ll tell mongoose to create a collection in mongodb and validate that collectionâ€™s data using the schema. We do this using the `mongoose.model` method:

```js
// models/pet.js
const Pet = mongoose.model('Pet', petSchema);
```

## Export the model from the `pet.js` file
Next, weâ€™ll export the `Pet` model we just created so that the rest of our application has access to it.

```js
// models/pet.js

module.exports = Pet;
```
 
Our finished `pet.js` file will look like this:

```js
// models/pet.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const petSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    min: 0,
  },
  breed: String,
});

const Pet = mongoose.model('Pet', petSchema);

module.exports = Pet;
```

## Import the model
Finally, weâ€™ll need the `Pet` model in many of our routes, so letâ€™s import it next. Similarly to our `models` directory, weâ€™ll be using a `controllers` directory to help keep a clear separation of concerns. Letâ€™s create that next:

```bash
mkdir controllers
touch controllers/pets.js
```

In `controllers/pets.js`, so letâ€™s add an import statement to the top of that file:

```js
// controllers/pets.js
const Pet = require('../models/pet.js');
```

Thatâ€™s it! Our model is set up and ready to be used in the request handling functions defined in our routes.
