# React Components - Destructuring Props

## Destructuring
Our work so far is great, but you'll notice that whenever we want to access a property on the `founder` object, we have to navigate through `props` repeatedly to get the data we need. Nothing is necessarily ***wrong*** with this, but you can imagine how this might become tedious, especially if we had even more objects nested inside the `founder` object. 

This is where [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring) comes into play. 

At its simplest, object destructuring allows you to assign a property of an object to a variable of the same name. Let's see it in action. Here's our existing `FounderListItem` component: 

```jsx
// src/components/FounderListItem/FounderListItem.jsx

const FounderListItem = (props) => {
  return (
    <li>
      <h3>Hello, I'm {props.founder.name} the {props.founder.title}!</h3>
      <p>{props.founder.credential}</p>
    </li>
  );
};

export default FounderListItem;
```

We'll start with the destructuring itself, which happens in the first line. Change it to: 

```
const FounderListItem = ({ founder }) => {
```

This syntax means: find the `founder` property on the first argument, and assign it to `founder`. `founder` now has all the properties that `props.founder` previously had. Note that there is no longer a `props` parameter available to use in this component, which means we need to do a slight refactor in this component for it to work properly: 

```jsx
// src/components/FounderListItem/FounderListItem.jsx

const FounderListItem = ({ founder }) => {
  return (
    <li>
      <h3>Hello, I'm {founder.name} the {founder.title}!</h3>
      <p>{founder.credential}</p>
    </li>
  );
};

export default FounderListItem;
```

All better! Again, destructuring isn't something you're required to do, but it's a common pattern used in documentation and other online resources. 

## Retaining access to `props`
It's not uncommon to want to retain access to everything passed on `props` but still destructure some things from it. The below syntax can accomplish this: 

```jsx
// src/components/FounderListItem/FounderListItem.jsx

const FounderListItem = (props) => {
  const { founder } = props
  return (
    <li>
      <h3>Hello, I'm {founder.name} the {founder.title}!</h3>
      <p>{founder.credential}</p>
    </li>
  );
};

export default FounderListItem;
```

`props` can now be used throughout the `FounderListItem` component, and `founder` has also been destructured so that it's still easy to access its properties. 

> Destructuring isn't just for React applications! This syntax is built into JavaScript; you can use it in any modern JavaScript app.
