# React Router DOM - Creating Routes

## Implementing client-side routing with React Router
With our navigation bar in place, we can now define the content that should be rendered at each location in our app with some client-side routing. Through client-side routing, we can render different components based on the URL, mimicking the functionality of a traditional multi-page website within a single-page application. 

To build our these routes, we use two components provided by React Router:
1. `<Route>`: Used to define individual routes within the application. Each `<Route>` specifies a `path` and an `element` to render when that path is accessed. 
2. `<Routes>`: Acts as a *container* for individual `<Route>` components. When a user accesses a URL, the `<Routes>` component looks through its child routes to find the best match, rendering the corresponding UI. 

Below is a diagram depicting the client-side routes that we'll build out in our application:

## Defining routes
At the top of `App.jsx`, let's import `Route` and `Routes` from `react-router`: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router';
```

Next, we'll need to adjust the `return` statement to include the `<Routes>` component. This `<Routes>` component will contain all of the individual routes for our application. 

Update the following in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Pokemon!</h1>
      <NavBar />
      <Routes>
        <PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
```

Currently, our navigation bar has a link directing users to `'/pokemon'`. Let's define a `<Route>` so that the `<PokemonList>` component is rendered at this path. 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/pokemon" element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />} />
      </Routes>
```

With the above `<Route>` component, we have defined a `path` as `/pokemon`and the `element` as the component `<PokemonList />` to render when that path is accessed. Note that we didn't change anything at all about the component itself; we're just defining what route it should be rendered on. 

Start up the app and open the browser. Click on the 'Pokemon' link in the nav bar to navigate to `'/pokemon'`. You should see the `pokemon` data being rendered! If you navigate back `'/'` with the 'Home' link, you might notice that only the page header and `<NavBar />` are being rendered. Let's address that issue in the next section. 

## Creating a default route
To set up a default route (home page), we *could* create a new `Homepage.jsx` component, but we can also define some JSX to render directly in the `element` prop. Let's go with the second option to better demonstrate some of the flexibility you have in building routes. 

Add the following to the `<Routes>` in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
        <Route path="/pokemon" element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />} />
      </Routes>
```

Try it our in your browser. Using the nav bar, try navigating between the two pages.
