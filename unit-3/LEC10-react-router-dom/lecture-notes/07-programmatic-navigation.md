# React Router DOM - Programmatic Navigation

## Understanding programmatic navigation
In web applications, users are often redirected to a different page after completing certain actions, like a form submission. React Router provides this functionality through the `useNavigate()` hook. With `useNavigate()`, we can navigate users programmatically, without traditional links. 

The `useNavigate()` hook returns a function that can be used for programmatic navigation: 

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

The `navigate` function is called upon with a string representing the path to direct the user towards:

```jsx
navigate('/some-path');
```

In our application, we'll demonstrate this by creating a form for adding a new Pokemon. After submitting the form, users will be redirected to the `/pokemon` route, where they can view the list of Pokemon, including the newly added one. 

## Adding the form component 
First let's create the form. 

Create a new component called `PokemonForm`:

```
mkdir src/components/PokemonForm
touch src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx
```

Add the following to `PokemonForm.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx

import { useState } from 'react';

const initialState = {
  name: '',
  weight: 0,
  height: 0,
};

const PokemonForm = (props) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState(initialState);

  const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    // TODO : complete submit logic
  };

  const handleChange = ({ target }) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [target.name]: target.value });
  };

  return (
    <main>
      <h2>New Pokemon</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          name="name"
          value={formData.name}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="weight">Weight:</label>
        <input
          type="number"
          id="weight"
          name="weight"
          value={formData.weight}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="height">Height:</label>
        <input
          type="number"
          id="height"
          name="height"
          value={formData.height}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  );
};

export default PokemonForm;
```

Note that we'll finish the `handleSubmit` function shortly. With our form in place we should be ready to build some navigation for it. 

## Adding navigation
Let's start by updating our `nav` bar with a link to the new component.


```jsx
// src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx

      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to='/'>Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to='/pokemon'>Pokemon</Link>
        </li>
        {/* A new link to our pokemon form page */}
        <li>
          <Link to="/pokemon/new">New Pokemon</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
```

Next, we'll define a new `<Route />` that matches the path as defined in our `<Link />`.

Add the following import to `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import PokemonForm from './components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm';
```

And add the new `<Route>` to `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
        <Route path="/pokemon" element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />} />
        {/* New route to add a pokemon with the Pokemon form */}
        <Route path="/pokemon/new" element={<PokemonForm />} />
        <Route
          path="/pokemon/:pokemonId"
          element={<PokemonDetails pokemon={pokemon} />}
        />
        <Route path="*" element={<h2>Whoops, nothing here!</h2>} />
      </Routes>
```

You should now be able to navigate to the new pokemon page and enter information in the form. 

> Route order does not matter in React Router, but it is easier to maintain your routes in a larger app if you place them in some order. Looking at the order above, we're using this type of ordering method.
1. Exact match to the root path (`/`)
2. Exact match on a specific path (`/pokemon`)
3. Exact match on a specific sub-path on that specific path (`/pokemon/new`)
4. Dynamic route parameters to sub-paths on that specific path (`/pokemon/:pokemonId`)
5. A catch all route for any other paths (`*`)

> We'll generally follow an order like this as we construct routes together, but it's good to remember that this is not a requirement. 

## Completing the form functionality 
Now we can make our form component fully-functional. To do so, we'll need a new function in `src/App.jsx` that adds new pokemon data to `pokemon` array state. 

Add the following function to `src/App.jsx`: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  const addPokemon = (newPokemonData) => {
    newPokemonData._id = pokemon.length + 1;
    setPokemon([...pokemon, newPokemonData]);
  };
```

Notice the `_id` property being added to `newPokemonData` before it's included in `pokemon` state. Here, we are giving the new pokemon object a unique identifier based the on current length of `pokemon` state. This is practical because we aren't using a database at the moment, and we wouldn't expect our users to enter a unique id value when filling out the form. 

Next, we'll need to pass the function down to our form component. 

Pass the `addPokemon` function to the `PokemonForm` component: 

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
        <Route path="/pokemon" element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />} />
        {/* Updated route passing PokemonForm the addPokemon prop */}
        <Route 
          path="/pokemon/new" 
          element={<PokemonForm addPokemon={addPokemon} />}
        />
        <Route
          path="/pokemon/:pokemonId"
          element={<PokemonDetails pokemon={pokemon} />}
        />
        <Route path="*" element={<h2>Whoops, nothing here!</h2>} />
      </Routes>
```

And finally, complete the `handleSubmit` function in the `PokemonForm` component by calling the new function: 

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx

  const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    props.addPokemon(formData);
    setFormData(initialState);
  };
```
> Notice how we are resetting form state after submission using `initialState`. This pattern is great to ensure consistency and prevent bugs. 

## Programmatic redirects
Time to handle the programmatic redirect. Remember, when a use submits a form, they should be redirected to the pokemon list page (`'/pokemon'`), We'll be working within `PokemonForm.jsx` for this step, although this could also be accomplished within `App.jsx`.

Inside `PokemonForm.jsx`, import `useNavigate` from `react-router`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx

import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';
```

Next, create a new instance of `useNavigate()` inside the component. Add this line right after we set up the `formData` state variable:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx

  const [formData, setFormData] = useState(initialState);
  // New code
  const navigate = useNavigate();
```

And finally, call the `navigate()` function within `handleSubmit` to redirect the user after state is updated: 

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonForm/PokemonForm.jsx

  const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    props.addPokemon(formData);
    setFormData(initialState);
    // Navigate to the pokemon list page after submission.
    navigate('/pokemon');
  };
```
> Be sure to pass in the path you with to direct the user to

Try it in the browser. 

You should now be directect to the pokemon list page after you submit the form.
