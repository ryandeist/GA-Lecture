# React Router DOM - Creating Links

## Understanding the `<Link>` component
React Router provides a `<Link>` component designed specifically for SPAs. It behaves much like the HTML `<a>` tag. The `<Link>` component allows users to change the path of the browser URL with a click, just like traditional web links. 

Take a look at the example of a `<Link>` component below:

```jsx
<Link to='/'>Home</Link>
```

vs.

```html
<a href="/">Home</a>
```

The `<Link>` component differs from the traditional `<a>` tag in that it accepts a `to` prop instead of an `href`. The `to` prop is used to specify the navigation target. This prop can be a string representing the path or an object if additional information is required. 

## Creating a navigation bar
Let's add some basic navigation to our application with a `nav` bar component.

Create a new component called `NavBar`:

```
mkdir src/components/NavBar
touch src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx
```

Add the following in `src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx

const NavBar = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Pokemon</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default NavBar;
```

In `src/App.jsx`, import the new component:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import NavBar from './components/NavBar/NavBar';
```

Next, add the `<NavBar />` component to the return:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
  return (
    <>
      <NavBar />
      <h1>Pokemon!</h1>
      <PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />
    </>
  );
```

With this basic HTML structure in place, we should now be ready to integrate some navigable links. 

## Implementing links
At the top of `NavBar.jsx`, we'll import `Link` from `react-router`:

```jsx
// src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx

import { Link } from 'react-router';
```

Next, update the list items in the `nav` bar by wrapping their content with a `<Link>` component: 

```jsx
// src/components/NavBar/NavBar.jsx

  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to='/'>Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to='/pokemon'>Pokemon</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
```

This transforms the text content into clickable links, allowing our users to navigate to the URL path defined in each `<Link>`. 

After adding the `<Link>` components, test out the navigation in your browser. Clicking on the links should **change the URL path in the browser**, but not the content displayed in your app yet. 

Although we are able to navigate between different locations in our app, we have to define what should be rendered at each of these locations. For that, we'll need to make use of React Router's `<Routes>` component. 

> You may want to check out [React Router's `NavLink` component](https://reactrouter.com/start/library/navigating#navlink) on your own as well. When your browser is on a route that matches the link specified in the `NavLink` component, an `active` class will be added to the element. This can useful for styling your navigation bar to indicate the current page.
