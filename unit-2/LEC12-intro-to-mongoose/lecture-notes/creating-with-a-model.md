# Intro to Mongoose - Creating with a model
## The `create()` method
Mongoose models provide various methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delte) operations. These methods are **asynchronous**, and facilitate the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of documents in the database.

A model's [`create()`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html#Model.create()) method is used for adding new documents to the database. It's an asynchronous function that takes an object as an argument and returns the newly created document up successful execution. 

> For the `create()` method to execute successfully, the input object must adhere to the structure defined by the model's schema. If the object does not match the schema, Mongoose will respond with an error

See below the anatomy of the `create()` method:

![anatomy of create()](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-mongoose/creating-with-a-model/assets/create-method.png)

1. **Document Returned**: The newly created document based on the schema
2. **Model**: The Mongoose model (`Todo`) used for the operation.
3. **Model Method**: The `create()` method of the model. 
4. **Object Argument**: The data used to create the document. 

## Creating a new todo
For this demonstration, we'll work within `queries.js`. Our setup here differs from a typical Node/Express application to focus on gaining a familiarity with Mongoose.

### Import the model
Import the `Todo` model at the top of the `queries.js`:

```
// queries.js
const Todo = require('./models/todo.js');
```

### Build the `createTodo` function
Build out a function to handle the creation of our new `todo`:"

```
// queries.js

const createTodo = async () => {

  const todoData = {
    text: "Learn JS",
    isComplete: false,
  };
  
  const todo = await Todo.create(todoData);
  console.log("New todo:", todo);
};
```

> Note: Data will typically arrive on the server via the `request` object, but for this example, we've hard coded some todo data in the function

In the `createTodo` function, we first define an object called `todoData`. It contains the details for our new todo. We then use the `Todo` models `create()` method to add this data as a docuement in the database. If the operation succeeds, the function outputs the newly created `todo` to the console. 

Next, we'll call `createTodo` within the `runQueries` function

```
// queries.js
const runQueries = async () => {
  console.log('Queries running.');
  await createTodo();
};
```

## Running the `createTodo` function
To execute the `createTodo` function, run the `queries.js` file with the following command:

```
node queries.js
```

Check your terminal for the following output:

```
New todo: {
  text: 'Learn JS',
  isComplete: false,
  _id: new ObjectId('65777e33f4a45a8462ae3054'),
  __v: 0
}
```

This output shows the newly created `todo` document. It includes the properties we specified, along with an automatically generated `_id` (a unique identifier assigned by MongoDB) and `_v`(a version key used to keep track of how many updates have been made to the document).

> In Mongoose, every document automatically gets and `_id` property, even if it's not explicitly defined in the schema. The `_id` is a unique identifier generated by Mongoose using MongoDB's `ObjectId` type. It ensures that each document in the database has at least one unique property that we can use to easily find/update/delete it, without affecting other documents.
