# Intro to Node - CJS vs ESM modules

## CommonJS vs ECMAScript modules

JavaScript modules come in two main flavors: CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript modules (ESM). Understanding their differences is important for writing code across environments and tooling ecosystems.

### CommonJS (CJS) modules

CJS modules were created to address the lack of a native module system in JavaScript for server-side environments. Before ESM was introduced, JavaScript did not have a built-in module standard, which made code organization and reuse more challenging in large-scale applications.

CJS modules filled this gap by providing a way to define encapsulated modules of code, which could then be used in other parts of a Node application.

#### Characteristics

- **Syntax**: Uses `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` to export.
- **Compatibility**: Native to Node and widely supported by most server-side frameworks.

#### Example

To require:

```javascript
const myModule = require('myModule');
```

To export:

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  console.log("Send me anywhere, I'm ready!");
};

module.exports = myFunction;
```

### ECMAScript modules (ESM)

ESM is the modern, official standard for module management in JavaScript. They were created to provide a standard, built-in module system that could be used across different environments, including the browser and server-side (Node) contexts.

Before the introduction of ESM, JavaScript lacked a native module system, leading to the development of various non-standard module formats like CJS.

#### Characteristics

- **Syntax**: Uses `import` and `export` statements.
- **Compatibility**: Natively supported in modern browsers and Node.

#### Example

To import:

```javascript
import myModule from 'myModule';
```

To export:

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  console.log("Send me anywhere, I'm ready!");
};

export default myFunction;
```

### When to use CJS

- **Node applications**: CJS is a great choice for building applications in Node because it's supported by default.
- **Working on existing projects or legacy code**: If you're working on a project that already uses CJS, it's usually best to stick with it for consistency.

### When to use ESM

- **Web development**: ESM is the only option for websites and web applications.
- **Starting new projects in Node**: If you're beginning a new project in Node and want to use the latest standards, ESM is a good default choice.
- **Sharing code between the browser and server**: If you plan to use the same code in both a web browser and a Node server, ESM makes this possible. ***CJS cannot be used for client-side code.***
