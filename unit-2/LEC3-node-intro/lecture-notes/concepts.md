# Intro to Node - Concepts:
## What is Node.js, and why do we use it?

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (commonly referred to as Node) is a JavaScript *runtime environment* that enables JavaScript code to be executed outside the browser. This means Node gives developers the necessary tools to build server-side JavaScript applications.

> A *runtime environment* is where an application runs. It provides all the necessary resources for code written in a specific language to execute. Node is ***not*** a programming language.

Node has several core features that make it a valuable tool for developers:

- **JavaScript everywhere**: Node allows JavaScript code to be used to construct back-end applications, meaning that the same language can be used to build both front-end web applications and back-end server applications.
- **Built-in libraries**: Node comes with libraries enabling features such as file system interaction and HTTP communication.
- **Cross-platform**: Node runs on major platforms, simplifying the development and deployment of applications. This is because the same code can achieve the same functionality across multiple operating systems.
- **Community support**: Node has a sizable developer community. This developer community and corporate backers such as Microsoft and Google mean that Node has extensive community support. Beyond this, Node has gathered a large community around [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/), the world's largest ecosystem of open-source libraries, extending Node's functionality. Developers can leverage various packages to add prebuilt features to their applications and reduce development time.
- **Fast Execution:** Node utilizes the V8 JavaScript Engine (the same engine used in Google Chrome) to compile JavaScript into machine code, leading to quicker code execution.

These features mean that Node can be used for a variety of applications, including:

- Developing tools for automation and scripting tasks in the terminal or command prompt such as building projects or running tests.
- Creating chat applications and gaming servers for real-time communication.
- Building applications that interact with file systems for reading, writing, and modifying files.
- Developing web servers to serve web pages and create RESTful APIs for client-server communication.
