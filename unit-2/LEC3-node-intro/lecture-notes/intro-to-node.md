# Intro to Node

## Concepts:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript apps to run outside of a browser. It is *NOT* a programming languages.

Node has several core feature that make it valueable.
- JavaScript everywhere. Allows JS to be used to make both back and front end applications. 
- Built-In Libraries: Node comes w. libraries enabling features like file system interactions and HTTP communication.
- Cross Platform: Node runs on major platform, simplifying programming for other all types of browswers and devices. 
- Fast. 
- Community Support - Has been developed and tested thoroughly by the community and will continue to be. 

Also has access to npm(Node Package Manager), the largest collection of open source libraries.

Node can be used for a variety of applications like,:
- Automation/Scripting Tools
- Creating chat application and gaming servers. 
- Building apps that interact with file systems.
- Developing Web Servers to build restful APIs.


## More About Node:
### Enthusiasm for Node
#### Developer Flexibility:
- Allows developers to use JavaScript everywhere, making it easier to work across the whole stack.
- Developer Utilization: Allows companies to have a more efficient and flexible developer workforce.

#### Business Implications:
- Cost Savings: Increased server performance and developer efficiency
- Wide Adoption: Node has been adopted widespread over several industries. 

### Node and performance
Node is highly performant, allowing business to handle more traffic with less hardware. This is thanks to Node's architecture.

#### Asynch and event-driven architecture:
Input/Output operations, especially network requests, can be time-consuming and often the bottle neck in web apps. 
- Node uses Asynch and event-driven architecture, meaning Input/Output operations to not block execution of other tasks in an app.
- As a result, Node can efficiently support a large number of concurrent connections.
