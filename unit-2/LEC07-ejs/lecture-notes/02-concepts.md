# EJS - Concepts
## Templating for full-stack applications
Learning a templating like EJS is an important step in your full stack development journey. Templates help bridge the gap between back-end logic and front-end presentation. This is because templates allow developers to generate HTML pages dynamically. If any data changes, users can immediately see those changes when the visit a page because the data its self hasnt been hard coded into HTML. 

For Example, consider a social media platform. Each user has their own home page showing their name, photos, updates, etc. Instead of creating unique homepages for each user, templates enable you to design a single layout with placeholders for each users unique data. 

## What is EJS?
Ejs is a templating tool that mixes regular HTML with JavaScript. It's not a framework or a language; it's a method to execute JavaScript within your HTML page. 

Like the social media example. 
> Instead of creating unique homepages for each user, templates enable you to design a single layout with placeholders for each users unique data. 

EJS ulilizes JavaScript to fill these placeholders with user specific data. When a user visits the site, EJS on the server fills in the placeholders with personalized details. The server then sends the complete HTML Page to the user's browser. This process enables the display of tailored information on the website without manually creating new pages for every change.

## Why learn EJS?
EJS is great for creating web application like blogs or e-commerce sites that need content to change based on user interactions or data. It simplifies displaying this dynamic content on your webpages. Learning EJS increases your versatility as a full-stack developer, enabling you to build more complex and interactive web applications using JavaScript. 

Because EJS embeds JavaScript directly into HTML, it is a natural choice for existing JavaSCript Developers to learn. Using JavaScript also makes it easier to manage the webpage's content dynamically, offering options for conditional rendering and complex page layouts.
