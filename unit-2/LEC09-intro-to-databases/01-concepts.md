# Intro to Databases - Concepts
## What is a database? 
An application uses a database to interact with, organize, and save - or persist - data. There are many types of database systems. but they share common traits:
* **Data Storage**: This is the primary function of a database - to store data.
* **Data Retrieval**: Databases provide tools to query stored data.
* **Data Manipulation**: Data held in a database can be modified or deleted.
* **Data Integrity**: Most database systems use mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of their data.

### The importance of databases
Databases play a cruicial role in almost all applications by providing a persistent storage mechanism for data. Unlike temporary storage in data structures like arrays and objects, databases ensure that data is not lost when an application is closed or refreshed. This persistence is key to maintaining data integrity and consistency across application uses. 

Beyond this, databases enable applications to create, read, update and delete data (commonly abbreviated as CRUD). Most apps use CRUD operations as a part of their core functionality. For example, a social media application likely allows users to create posts, read posts, edit posts (update), and delete their posts. 

In short, databases let applications provide dynamic, personalized experiences to usets by allowing data to persist and evolve. Understanding how databases function is fundamental in producing robust, data-driven applications as you progress in your journey as a developer.
