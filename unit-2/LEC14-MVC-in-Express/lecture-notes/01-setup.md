## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/lectures`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

## Cloning the starter code

This lecture uses the [`MEN Stack CRUD App Fruits Solution`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-fruits-solution) as starter code. This insures a uniform starting point for our file structure before we make any directory changes. If you have your own complete copy of this application, you can choose to use that instead.

Navigate to the [MEN Stack CRUD App Fruits Solution](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-fruits-solution) and clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-fruits-solution.git
```

`cd` into the starter code directory:

```bash
cd men-stack-crud-app-fruits-solution
```

Open the contents of the directory in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```
