# MEN Stack Session Auth - Concepts
## What is Authentication?:
At its core, authentication is the process of verifying a users identity. It's like asking "Are you really who you claim to be?" In practical terms, this involves implementing a system where users can create an account with a usernam and password. Then, whenever they wish to access certain features or data on our site, they must provide the correct password to prove their identity and continue. 

## Why use Authentication:
As our applications grow more complex, with databases and relationships, it becomes vital to ensure that users can interact only with data that's relavant to their account. This is where authentication plays a critical role. It's the logic that identifies users, granting them access to create, view or modify content specific to their profile. Without authorization, we risk exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized modifications, which could compromise the integrity and security of our application and its users.
