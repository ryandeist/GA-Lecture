# Intro to Express - Concepts:

## Introduction to the Express framework:
The most widely used JavaScript framework for Node.js. It is flexible and minimalistic, which simplifies the process of building robust server side applications.
### Why choose Express?:
- Simplicity and Control: Express' minimalistic nature means less initial overhead doe developers and more control over the architecture and features of their applications. 
- Versatility:
    * Web Applications: Serving dynamic HTML content
    * Web Servers: Handling static and dynamic requests
    * APIs: Creating endpoints for client-server communication

In this module, we'll focus primarily on developing web applications using Express:

## Core Functionalities of Web App Frameworks 
Express exemplifies the key features of web application frameworks, which are essential for building efficient server-side solutions:

1. Routing: Defining routes (URLS) that client apps can request, crucial for organizing parts of your application. Processing incoming requests, parsing data, and making decisions based on the route and HTTP method
3. Response Generation: Combining data with templates to create dynamic content, or directly sending data as a response to client requests. 

Understanding these concepts is vital for developing web applications that are responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly.
