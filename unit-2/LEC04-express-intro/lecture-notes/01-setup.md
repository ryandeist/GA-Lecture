## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `intro-to-express`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir intro-to-express
cd intro-to-express
```

Create a `server.js` file. This file will hold your work for this lecture:

```bash
touch server.js
```

In the terminal, initialize a new Node project with all the default settings by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Finally, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```
