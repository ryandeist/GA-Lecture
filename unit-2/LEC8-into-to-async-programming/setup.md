## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/lectures`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called **`intro-to-asynchronous-programming`**, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir intro-to-asynchronous-programming
cd intro-to-asynchronous-programming
```

Then, create an **`app.js`** file. This file will hold your work for this lecture:

```bash
touch app.js
```

With the files created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

With this setup complete, we'll use Node to executing the code we write in **`app.js`**:

```bash
node app.js
```
