Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `html-forms`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir html-forms
cd html-forms
```

Then, create an `index.html` file. This file will hold your work for this lecture:

```bash
touch index.html
```

With the files created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Open the `index.html` file and add HTML boilerplate by typing `!` and then hitting the `Tab` key.

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
