# JavaScript Control Flow - Nested Branch Statements.

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand how to effectively use nested branching statements in JavaScript to handle complex conditional scenarios.

Sometimes, you'll encounter situations where one condition depends on another. In such cases, you can use nested `if` statements. These are `if` statements placed inside other `if` or `else` blocks, allowing for more complex decision-making. Here's an example:


```js
const dayOfTheWeek = 'Friday';
const isAfternoon = true;

if (dayOfTheWeek === 'Friday') {
  if (isAfternoon) {
    console.log('Almost the weekend!');
  } else {
    console.log('Happy Friday morning!');
  }
} else {
  console.log("It's not Friday.");
}
```

Clarity and simplicity are essential when using branching in your code. Complex nested conditions can be challenging to understand, so use this sparingly. Always strive for readability.
