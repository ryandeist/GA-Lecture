# Intro to CLI - The `man` command

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to utilize the `man` command and `--help` flag to access and interpret the manual pages and help information for various commands.

Each command has a different set of flags and arguments it accepts. We can easily view this information without leaving our terminal environment using a command.

The `man` command, short for manual, allows us to view a manual page for most commands.

For example, you can run `man rm` to view the list of flags that the `rm` command accepts.

Since man is also a command, you can even run `man man` to view more details about the man command.

Some commands may also have the `--help` or `-h` flag. This flag can be used to display the help information for some commands. See the `Flags Lesson` for more details about flags.
