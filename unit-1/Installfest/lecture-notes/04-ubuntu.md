# Installfest - Ubuntu

Please only proceed with this guide if you cannot use Windows or macOS. While developing on Ubuntu is more than possible, many course tools we use, such as Zoom, perform better on Windows or macOS. Proceed at your own risk.

## What you need to begin *(you must read this, do not skip this, this is important)*

- ***A device running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).***
- At least 20GB of free hard drive space.
- At least 8GB of RAM. 16GB of RAM or more is preferable and will improve your learning experience (particularly when screen sharing in Zoom).
- A user account with administrative privilege to your local installation of Ubuntu.
- A fundamental understanding of Linux system administration and debugging.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during installfest, please reach out to your installfest point of contact.

## Slack

We will be using Slack to communicate throughout the course. Download the `.deb` app from Slack **[here](https://slack.com/downloads/)** and install it. Please do not use the in-browser version of Slack, as it makes managing notifications unnecessarily difficult and makes it easy to miss important class information - the app is the way to go.

We also recommend downloading the Slack app for your mobile device to stay in touch on the go.

## Zoom

We'll hold class in Zoom. If you haven't already, download the Zoom client from **[here](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting)** and install it.

## Visual Studio Code

We will use VS Code as our code editor in class. Download and install the `.deb` package for VS Code **[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

## A note on copying commands

When possible, ***please copy the commands from this page***. You will use most of the commands here once and never again. Typing them out will only introduce the possibility of you making errors. Certain commands will require you to alter portions of them - this is specifically called out when they appear. There are no bonus points for doing work already done for you.

### Copying text in code blocks

To copy text from code blocks, use your mouse to hover over the code block. A **Copy** button will appear in the upper right corner. Click this, and the text held in the code block will be put on your clipboard, ready to be pasted. By default, you'll need to use **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `V`** to paste into the Ubuntu terminal.

![A codebock shown in GitHub pages. The Copy button is being pointed at by a red arrow.](../assets/code-copy.png)

## Launch the Terminal application

To quickly launch applications, press the **`Super`** key (this is the name of the **`Windows`** key on your keyboard in Ubuntu) to launch System Search view and type **`Terminal`**. Select the Terminal application by pressing **`Enter`** when it appears. Get used to doing this often; it's the fastest way to start applications on Ubuntu!

![Launching the Terminal application using Spotlight. Get used to seeing this often; it's the fastest way to start applications on the Mac!](../assets/terminal-system-search.png)

The Terminal application should start!

## Updating and upgrading packages

Your Linux installation will not automatically perform updates, so run this command now to update manually:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

To run a command, paste (or type) it into your terminal, confirm it matches what you intended, and press the **`Enter`** key.

You'll be prompted for your user password and to accept the changes to be made. Do so. As you type your password in, you'll notice it doesn't appear in the terminal. This is normal for password entry; keep typing it in and hit **`Enter`** when you're done.

![The output of the command to update Ubuntu packages.](../assets/update-and-upgrade.png)

Above, you can see a potential output of the command to update Ubuntu packages. Your output may be different from this, but that's ok!

## curl

Since you already have the terminal open, take the opportunity to install `curl`, which will let you install applications with just a URL, as you'll see us do soon. Use this command:

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

## Zsh

Bash is Ubuntu's default shell (command interpreter), but Z shell is more commonly used in modern systems by default, so that's what we will use. Install it with this command, and accept the changes to be made by entering **`Y`** when prompted to continue:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Verify the installation with this command:

```bash
zsh --version
```

The version number should be 5.8 or greater

Make Zsh the default shell with this command:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

You may be prompted to provide your password. Do so!

End your terminal session by closing the terminal window. Log out of your account, then log back in.

Open a new terminal window. As shown below, you should be prompted to run a configuration setup for new users:

![The terminal after installing `zsh`.](../assets/zsh-first-launch-u.png)

Enter `2` to accept the default configuration.

Your terminal prompt should look a little different now!

![zsh in action!](../assets/zsh-in-action-u.png)

Let's confirm it worked with this command:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

This should print **`/usr/bin/zsh`**.

## GitHub (GH)

At its core, GitHub (commonly abbreviated as GH) is a service for hosting Git repositories (which we'll talk about soon) in the cloud, but it also enables developers to collaborate on projects much more effectively. It might help to think of it as a social media platform for you and more than 100 million developers worldwide.

If you don't have an account there, create one now. Visit **[`https://github.com`](https://github.com)** and sign up. While there are paid account tiers, GitHub offers a very generous free tier that offers more than you need for the course.

## Git

Ensure you have access to the most recent stable version of Git with this command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
```

You may be prompted for your Ubuntu password. If you are, enter it. When prompted to continue, press **`Enter`**. If you encounter an error during this process, check out the **Handling errors ðŸ’”** sub-section below.

Then enter:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

and then finally, use this command to install Git on your machine:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Enter **`Y`** when prompted to continue.

### Handling errors ðŸ’”

After running the `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa` command above, you may encounter an `HTTPError`. If you do, ensure that your system date and time are correct, then try the same command again. If this does not resolve your issue, reach out to your Installfest point of contact for assistance!

### Git config

With Git installed, we can now make some configuration changes to make it a more effective tool. Complete all of the following configuration steps.

Use the below command to add a user name to Git, which will be used to identify your commits. Replace `User Name` with a name of your choice. Make sure you leave the quotes surrounding your username. Keep the name somewhat professional, or just use your name - this will be used to identify your commits on GitHub. There will not be any output from this command.

```bash
git config --global user.name "User Name"
```

Next, use the below command to add an email to Git, which will be used to identify your commits. Replace `user@email.com` with the email address associated with your **[`https://github.com`](https://github.com)** account. ***The email you provide MUST match the email address associated with your GitHub account.*** Ensure you leave the quotes surrounding your email. There will not be any output from this command. If you donâ€™t have a **[`https://github.com`](https://github.com)** account yet, create one before you run this.

```bash
git config --global user.email "user@email.com"
```

Set the default branch name to `main` with the below command. There will not be any output from this command.

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Set the default Git editor to VS Code with the below command. There will not be any output from this command.

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

By default, Git will ask for a new commit message when commits are brought into a Git repo. The following command will force the default commit message for all those commits instead of prompting you to add a commit message. While this isnâ€™t a Git command, weâ€™re still tackling it as part of this section since it changes Git's behavior. There will not be any output from this command.

```bash
echo "export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Finally, turn off rebasing as the default behavior when pulling from a repo with the below command. There will not be any output from this command.

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

### Configuring a `.gitignore_global` file

***Note: This step is vital to getting a job after the course. If you do not complete these steps exactly, it will look extremely bad to a future employer when they look over your GitHub repos.***

Proper code, utilities, and the use of Git ignore files prevent us from uploading private secrets to the internet.

A global Git ignore file (**`.gitignore_global`**) will prevent us from uploading private secrets to the internet across all of your projects so that you don't have to worry about making the appropriate entries in every project's Git ignore file.

Use this command to create a **`.gitignore_global`** file in the user directory:

```bash
touch ~/.gitignore_global
```

There will not be any output from this command.

Next, configure Git to use this file:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Open the new **`.gitignore_global`** file in VS Code:

```bash
code ~/.gitignore_global
```

![Creating and opening `~/.gitignore_global` in VS Code running the `code` command.](../assets/vsc-first-launch-u.png)

This may be your first time launching VS Code to work with an actual file. If so, congrats! You'll  arrive at a page that should look a lot like this:

![The new .gitignore_global file open in VS Code.](../assets/vsc-gig-launch-u.png)

Here, you see the new **`.gitignore_global`** file open in VS Code.

### Here is a [.gitignore_global file for you to use](../global-git-ignore.md)

Open the above page and copy the contents of the code block from the page with the copy button. Note that you must be logged in to your GHE account to access this page!

Return to VS Code, then click inside the editor (the main portion of the VS Code window).

Paste the contents of the file you copied into the editor in VS Code. Doing this should result in your VS Code window looking similar to this:

![The end of the new .gitignore_global file.](../assets/vsc-gig-content.png)

Congrats, you just edited your first file in VS Code! This is a great time to turn on **Auto Save**! The **Auto Save** setting is in the **File** menu - select it, then re-open the **File** menu to ensure that there is a checkmark next to the **Auto Save** option, as shown below.

![Auto Save checked in the File menu, indicating that Auto Save is enabled.](../assets/vsc-auto-save-enabled-u.png)

This should save the file, but let's be sure by manually saving it by using **Save** in the **File** Menu or pressing **`Ctrl + S`**.

You can close VS Code for now.

## Oh My Zsh

We will also install Oh My Zsh - an "open-source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration." Use this command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

![A successful installation of Oh My Zsh](../assets/oh-my-zsh-success-u.png)

Note that your prompt has now changed to simply be `~`. This is the desired outcome!

## Node.js

Use this command to install `nvm`, which we will use to install Node.js. `nvm` stands for [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and can be used to swap between different versions of Node.js quickly. We won't swap between different versions in the course, but it's still a handy tool for managing our Node.js install and can help you manage your Node.js installation post-course. Get `nvm` with this command:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

You may see this prompt part way through the install process:

![Error message reads: (Head detached at FETCH_HEAD). That can't be good!](../assets/nvm-head-detached.png)

If you do, just hit **`q`** - that will exit this screen and return you to the below install process. If you don't get this error, that's great; continue until you see the completed installation of `nvm`:

![The completed installation of nvm.](../assets/nvm-install-complete-u.png)

**Restart the Terminal application now.**

After starting up the Terminal again, run this command to check the version of `nvm`:

```bash
nvm --version 
```

If you do not get a version number, check out the **Handling errors ðŸ’”** subsection below; otherwise, continue.

Use nvm to install node version 20 with this command:

```bash
nvm install 20
```

![A successful install of node v20.11.0](../assets/node-install-complete-u.png)

A successful install of node v20.11.0. Your version may be slightly different from this, but as long as it starts with 20 everything is ok!

### Handling errors ðŸ’”

#### command not found: nvm error

Copy this command block and run it in the terminal, which will point to the nvm directory in your **`~/.zshrc`** file:

```bash
cat << EOF >> ~/.zshrc

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
EOF
```

Restart your terminal. You should now be able to run the `nvm --version` command and get a version number in response. If you do not, alert your installfest point of contact.

### NPM config

Run this command to disable `npm` update notifications since this process is managed by `nvm`:

```jsx
npm config set update-notifier false
```

There will be no output after running this command.

## nodemon

With Node.js installed, install `nodemon` globally with this command:

```bash
npm i -g nodemon
```

If nodemon has successfully installed, this should be the output:

![nodemon successfully installed!](../assets/nodemon-install-complete-u.png)

## `~/code` directory

You'll need somewhere on your computer to put all of your work in the course - that's what the `~/code` directory will be for you! All course content assumes you will have this directory, so let's create it now with this command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir ~/code
```

## OH WOW YOU DID IT!

You are now set up to start developing in Ubuntu! Be very proud of yourself; that was quite the process!
