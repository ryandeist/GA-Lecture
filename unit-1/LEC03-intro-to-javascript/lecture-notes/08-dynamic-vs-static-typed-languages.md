# Intro to JavaScript - Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand the fundamental difference between dynamically-typed and statically-typed programming languages, with examples from JavaScript and C++.

*Dynamically-typed* languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby allow variables to be assigned different types of data during runtime (as the program executes). 

For example, in JavaScript, we can do this:

```js
// Declare a variable named data and initialize with a number
let data = 123;
// Reassigning a different type of data is allowed
data = 'Hello';
```

However, *statically-typed* languages such as Java and C++ require a variable's type to be declared and cannot be changed:

```c
// Declare a variable as an integer and initialize it with an int
int data = 123;
// Assigning anything other than an integer raises an error
data = "Hello"; 
// NOT ALLOWED
```

> ðŸ“š In a *dynamically-typed* language, the type of a variable can change at any time and is assigned a type based on whatever the variable's value is at the time. In a *statically-typed* language, once a variable is given a type, that type cannot change.
