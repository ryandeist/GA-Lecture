# Python Data Structures - Sets

## Introduction to sets in Python
A ***set*** is an unordered collection of unique items called ***elements***. Unlike lists and tuples, sets do not allow duplicate elements. Sets are not indexed. Elements in a set can be added and removed but cannot be changed.

Sets are commonly used for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference. This makes them useful for tasks such as removing duplicates and finding common elements in multiple collections.

## Creating sets
There are two ways to define a set in Python - using curly braces (`{}`) or the `set()` function.

### Curly braces `{}`
Create a set from scratch using curly braces:

```py
integer_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

The `set()` function
Or, more commonly, create a set from an iterable data type, like a list or tuple.

```py
another_int_set = set([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

chips = ['potato', 'computer', 'fish and']

chips_set = set(chips)
```

## Operations on sets
Sets support various operations such as adding elements, removing elements, and performing mathematical set operations.

## Adding elements
In Python, you can add elements to a set using the `add()` method.

```py
# Adding elements to a set
chips_set.add('paint')
print(chips_set)
# prints: {'paint', 'fish and', 'potato', 'computer'}
# remember, sets are not ordered - your elements may print in a different order
```

### Removing elements
To remove elements from a set in Python, you can use the `remove()` method.

```py
# Removing elements from a set
chips_set.remove('fish and')
print(chips_set)
# prints: {'potato', 'paint', 'computer'}
# remember, sets are not ordered - your elements may print in a different order
```

### Mathematical operations
Sets can help performing more complex mathematical operations, such as discovering overlap between two collections of data - check out this tutorial from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-sets/) for more.
