# Intro to Python - Setup

## Setup
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `intro_to_python`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir intro_to_python
cd intro_to_python
```

Then create an `intro_to_python.py` file with:

```bash
touch intro_to_python.py
```

A quick note on convention - you’ll note that we’re using underscores (`_`) in this filename/directory instead of dashes (`-`). This follows the PEP style guide for python modules and packages.

Open the contents of the directory in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```
