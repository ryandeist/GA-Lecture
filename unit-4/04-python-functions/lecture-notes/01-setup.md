# Python Functions - Setup

## Setup
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `python_functions`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir python_functions
cd python_functions
```

Once in this directory, create a `functions.py` file:

```bash
touch functions.py
```

With the file created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
