# Python Functions - Defining and Calling Functions 

## Function syntax
A function definition will have the following syntax:

![function syntax](../assets/function-diagram.png)

1. The `def` keyword.
2. The name of the function. It should be written in `snake_case`.
3. The parameter list, inside parentheses.
4. The body of the function is indicated by a colon.
    - 4a. The statements that make up the function itself. These must be indented.
    - 4b. Optionally, a `return` statement.

## Defining a function
A basic function definition could look something like this:

```py
def do_nothing():
    pass
```

This function does nothing at all. Youâ€™ll recall in JavaScript, we can create empty functions by not including anything inside the body (`{ }`) of a function.

The `pass` statement doesnâ€™t do anything. Weâ€™re using it here to ensure this function has at least one statement in its block. This is required in Python.

Hereâ€™s a function that does a little more:

```py
def print_banner():
    print("=======================")
    print("Insert banner text here")
    print("=======================")
```

This function logs three lines of text to the console.

## Calling a function
Just like in JavaScript, defining a function does not execute it. A function must be called for it to run.

If we wanted to call the `print_banner()` function from our previous example, we would do so like this:

```py
print_banner()
```
> ðŸš¨ You cannot invoke a Python function before the code that defines the function. For example, this will not work:
>
>```py
>print_banner()
>
>def print_banner():
>    print("=======================")
>    print("Insert banner text here")
>    print("=======================")
>```
> Instead, do this:
>
>```py
>def print_banner():
>    print("=======================")
>    print("Insert banner text here")
>    print("=======================")
>
>print_banner()

Just like in JavaScript, functions are reusable, and we can call the same function more than once.

Also, like in JavaScript, all functions return something, even when we donâ€™t specify something to return. When we donâ€™t return anything from a function in JavaScript, it returns `undefined`. In Python, functions that we donâ€™t specify a return for return `None`:

```py
print(do_nothing())
# prints: None
```

## Key differences between Python and JavaScript functions
Besides the noticeable syntactical differences, here are a few other things to be aware of:

### Function expressions do not exist in Python
Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. However, unlike in JavaScript, you cannot define a function in Python by assigning it to a variable:

```py
# this does not work
my_function = def my_function():
    pass
```

### Python has a different sort of anonymous/inline function
Like JavaScript, Python has the concept of anonymous and/or inline functions. These are called lambda functions in Python and have a special syntax.

Lambda functions are very much like *arrow functions* in JavaScript:

- They implicitly return a single expressionâ€™s result.
- They can be assigned to a variable.

However, they cannot have any code blocks - only a single expression with its result implicitly returned.

For example, in JavaScript, we might have something that looks like this:

```js
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 6, 5];
let odds = nums.filter(num => num % 2);
```

This same behavior and functionality could be duplicated in Python:

```py
nums = [1, 3, 2, 6, 5]
odds = list(filter(lambda num: num % 2, nums))
```

Lambda functions are useful when using Python functions such as `map()`, just like how arrow functions are when using JavaScriptâ€™s array iterator methods.
