# Intro to SQL - Creating Databases and Tables

## Creating a Database
During this lesson, we will use the PostgreSQL command-line tool - psql.

Now that we know more about SQL and relational databases, letâ€™s create a new database to store some data. We will start with a database called `music` with a table called `bands`.

Once in the PostgreSQL command line tool, you can create a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE` command. Letâ€™s create a database called `music`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE music; -- Remember the semicolon!
```
> ğŸ’¡ Comments in SQL begin with `--.`

Confirm that youâ€™ve successfully created the database with this command:

```sql
\l
```

Using `\l`, you can list all the databases in your PostgreSQL server. You should see the `music` database listed.
> ğŸ§  Hit the `q` key to exit the list view.

Before creating a new table in the `music` database, we must connect to it. You can connect to a database using the `\c` command followed by the name of the database:

```sql
\c music -- connect to the music database
```
The prompt should change to `music=#`, indicating you are now connected to the `music` database.

## Creating a Table
With our database set up, the next step is to create a table to organize and store specific data. Weâ€™ll start by creating a table called `bands`, which will hold information about various musical bands.

Our `bands` table will have three columns: `id`, `name`, and `genre`.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Notes |
| :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---- | 
| id | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY | A unique identifier for each band. We use the SERIAL data type here, which automatically generates a new, incremental number for each entry, ensuring each band has a unique ID. |
| name | VARCHAR | NOT NULL | Weâ€™ve chosen VARCHAR as the data type, which allows us to store strings of varying lengths. The NOT NULL constraint ensures that every band entered into the database must have a name. |
| genre | VARCHAR |  | This is also VARCHAR. However, this column has no constraints so providing this data is optional. |

To create this table in PostgreSQL, we use the `CREATE TABLE` command.

```sql
CREATE TABLE bands (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  genre VARCHAR
);
```
> ğŸ’¡ Inside the parentheses, we define the columns and their respective settings, such as data types and constraints.

After creating the table, itâ€™s good practice to check that it has been set up correctly. You can list all the tables in your `music` database using the command `\dt`. If the `bands` table has been created successfully, it will appear in the list output after running this command.
