# Intro to SQL - Anatomy of a Relational Database

## Schema
The structure of a relational database is defined by its **schema**.

A schema defines multiple elements of a database, including:

- **Tables**: These include specifications of columns and data types.
- **Indexes**: These are used for faster retrieval of data.
- **Constraints**: These are rules that ensure data integrity (such as whether a field can be null or not).

## Tables
Tables are the core components of a relational database. Hereâ€™s a simple view of what database tables might look like. This looks similar to a table in a spreadsheet for a good reason - both are structured as tables composed of ***columns*** and ***rows***:

A table in a relational database holds data for a particular *data resource* such as ***employees***, which is represented in columns like `name`, `role`, and `start_date`.

> ðŸ“š A *data resource* represents a real-world object or concept. It is a group of definable things, like customers, orders, reviews, movies, etc. A resource is composed of *entities* - each stored as a row within the table. Each column of the table holds a specific attribute. Collectively, columns describe the properties of each entity.

## Columns and rows
### Rows (Records)
A row in a table represents a single instance of the data entity.

For example, a particular **artist** is in an **artists** table.

TABLE: **artists**

| id (PK) | name | nationality |
| :------ | :--- | :---------- |
| 1 | Prince | American |
| 2 | Sir Elton John | British |


TABLE: **songs**

| id (PK) | name | year_released | artist_id (FK) |
| :------ | :--- | :------------ | :------------- |
| 1 | Tiny Dancer | 1971 | 2 |
| 2 | Little Red Corvette | 1982 | 1 |
| 3 | I Would Die 4 U | 1984 | 1 |
| 4 | Your Song | 1970 | 2|


### Columns (Fields)
The columns of a table have a:

- Name
- Data type (all data in a column must be of the same type)
- Optional constraints

The typical naming convention is usually snake_cased and singular.

PostgreSQL has many data types for columns, but common ones include:

- `integer`
- `decimal`
- `varchar` (variable-length strings)
- `text` (same as varchar)
- `date` (does not include time)
- `timestamp` (both date and time)
- `boolean`

Typical constraints for a column include:

- `PRIMARY KEY`: column, or group of columns, uniquely identify a row
- `REFERENCES` (Foreign Key): value in a column must match the primary key in another table
- `NOT NULL`: column must have a value; it cannot be empty (null)
- `UNIQUE`: data in this column must be unique among all rows in the table

### Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK)
The field that uniquely identifies each row in the table are known as that tableâ€™s **primary key (PK)**.

Since only one type of data entity can be held in a single table, related data, for example, the **songs** for an **artist**, are stored in separate tables and linked via what is known as a **foreign key (FK)**.
