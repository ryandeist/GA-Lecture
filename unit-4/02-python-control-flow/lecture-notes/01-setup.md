# Python Control Flow - Setup

## Setup
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `python_control_flow`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir python_control_flow
cd python_control_flow
```

Once in this directory, create a `control_flow.py` file:

```bash
touch control_flow.py
```

With the file created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```
