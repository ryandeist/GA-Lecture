# Python Control Flow - Truthy and Falsy

## Truthy and falsy in Python
Like JavaScript, every piece of data in Python is considered either ***truthy*** or ***falsy***.

Conditional expressions used to construct branching and looping code rely on an expression evaluating to `True`/truthy or `False`/falsy to determine which path the code will follow.

Just like in JavaScript, most things in Python are considered to be truthy, so itâ€™s easier to remember what is falsy instead.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s ***falsy*** in Python:

- `False`
- `None`
- Zero in any numeric type: `0` `0.0`
- Empty sequences or collections:
    - `''` (empty string)
    - `[]` (empty list)
    - `()` (empty tuple)
    - `{}` (empty dictionary)
    - `range(0)` (empty range)

> ðŸ§  The first thing you might notice here is how closely this aligns with what is falsy in JavaScript. Note that `[]` and `{}`in JavaScript are truthy, but falsy in Python.
