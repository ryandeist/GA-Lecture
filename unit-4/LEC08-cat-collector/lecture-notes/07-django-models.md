# Cat Collector - Django Models
**Learning objective**: By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to understand the role of the Model layer in the Django architecture, define Models to represent database entities, and perform basic CRUD operations using these Models.

## The Model Layer in the Django Architecture
This lesson focueses on the **Model Layer** which provides **Views** with access to the **database**.

## What's a Model?
**Models** are used to perform CRUD data operations on a database. 

Remember **entities** in the Entity-Relationship-Diagrams? 

A Django Model represents a single entity from the ERD.

This, a Model has a one-to-one mapping with a table in the database and is what allows us to perform create, read, update and delete data operations on that table. 

When we retrieve data from the database (using a Model), we will have **model objects**, each of which represents a row in a database table. Model objects are also called *instances* of the Model. We can work with these instances of the Model just like how we worked with Mongoose documents.

> Note: Since a "model" can technically refer to the Model class or an instance of that class, we will try to use "Model" (capitalized) to refer to a Model class we use to perform CRUD with and "model" (lowercased) to refer to a model instance. 

Here's an ERD for the future state of Cat Collector:

## Models in Django
Each Model is defined as a Python class that inherits from `django.db.models.Model`.

Here's the **Cat** entity from the ERD and the code to define the equivalent Model:

![](../assets/cat-model.png)

## Creating a Model
All of the Models for a Django app are defined in the app's `models.py` file. 

Let's create a `Cat` model in `main_app/models.py`:

```py
from django.db import models

class Cat(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    breed = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=250)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```
> When defining fields in a Django model, each field is represented by a specific Field class, such as `CharField` for character strings. You can explore all the available field types in the [Django documentation on model field types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types), which provides a variety of options to suit different data needs.

These field types are important for several reasons:
1. **Validation**: Django uses the field types to apply automatic data validation in forms, ensuring that data conforms to the expected format before it's processed or stored.
2. **Form Rendering**: The field type also determines the default HTML widget used in forms.

For example:
- A `CharField` will typically render as an `<input type="text">` HTML element.
- A `TextField` will render as a `<textarea>`, suitable for longer text inputs.

## Adding a `__str__` method in Models
It's best practice to override the `__str__` method in Models so that they will print in a more helpful way. 

For the `Cat` model, we'll code `__str__` to return the cat's `name` attribute.

```py
class Cat(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    breed = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=250)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    # new code below
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Watch your indentation here! This is a class method so it belongs in the `Cat` class.

## Connecting to the Database
### Installing the PostgreSQL Adapter
Before we can connect to a PostgreSQL database, we need to install the necessary adapter in our Django project's virtual environment. Run the following command in your terminal to install the `pstcopg2-binary` package, which allow Django to communicate with PostgreSQL databasees: 

```bash
pipenv install psycopg2-binary
```

After installation, you can verify that the package has been added by checking your `Pipfile.`

### Creating the `catcollector` Database
In a separate terminal window run the following command: 

```bash
createdb catcollector
```

Verify its creation by entering the `psql` shell: 

```bash
psql
```

and checking your list of Databases:

```sql
\l
```

Hit enter to exit this view, and run: 

```
\q
```
to exit the shell. 

### Configuring Django to Use PostgreSQL
By default, Django uses SQLite3, which is a minimalist DB suitable for development, but might not be robust enough for production environments. 

To switch to PostgreSQL
1. **Navigate to the `settings.py`** file located in your project directory `catcollector/settings.py`.
2. **Find the `DATABASES` configuration**: This setting defines the details of the database connection. Initially, it's set to use SQLite3, as shown below:

    ```py
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Modify the configuration for PostgreSQL**: Replace the SQLite settings with PostgreSQL settings. You will specify the `ENGINE` as `django.db.backends.postgresql`, and you'll also need to define the database `NAME` which is the name of your PostgreSQL database. 

    After the changes, your settings should look like this: 

    ```py
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'catcollector',
        }
    }
    ```

This configuration tells Django to use a PostgreSQL database named `catcollector` for storing all data. Make sure that you have created this database in your PostgreSQL server before running your Django application.

## Making and running migrations
### What are Migrations
[Migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/) are a way to keep the database schema in sync with your Django models. They track changes to your models and apply these changes to your database schema over time, which is essential as the needs of your application evolve. 

While migrations are powerful for evolving your database schema, the can be potentially destructive - especially in a production environment - because they can lead to data loss. It's important to handle them with care.

To create migrations, Django provides commands that you can run in your terminal. These commands generate Python files that describe the changes to be made to the database.

### Making Migration Files
Once you've defined a model, like our `Cat` model, the next step is to update the database so it can store data for this model. Before the database knows about our `Cat` model, we need to create migration files. 

Run the command below in your terminal to generate migrations for any models that have been added or changed since your last update: 

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

This command prepares migration files, which Django uses to align the database structure with your current model definitions. 

The output in the terminal informs use that the following migration file was created: `main_app/migrations/0001_initial.py`

A `migrations` directory is created for an **app** the first time you run `makemigrations`.

### Examining Migration Files 
After creating migration files, you typically don't need to modify them. However, since this is our first migration, it's useful to understand what's inside. Go ahead and open the newly created migration file to see how Django plans to update your database schema.
> **Note**: While it's possible to manually edit migration files, it's generally not recommended, especially while you are still learning. Manual edits can lead to unexpected database behaviors and complications. 

### Running Migrations
Simply creating migration files does not update the database's schema. 

To sychronize the database with the code in the migration files, we "migrate" using this command in the terminal: 

```bach
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Lots of `OK` messages is what you're looking for. 

> **Rule of Thumb for Migrations**: Whenever you modify a model, always remember to create and apply migrations. This ensures that your database schema is up-to-date with your model definitions.
> **Team Collaboration**: In a team setting, designate only one person to create migrations to avoid conflicts. However, every team member should apply these migrations to their local development environment.

## What was exactly created in the database?
To check our the database to see this table being added, we can use our `psql` command in the terminal: 

```bash 
psql catcollector
```

Then, we can list the tables in the database:

```sql
\dt
```

You should see a table named `main_app_cat` listed~

```sql

catcollector=# \dt
                     List of relations
 Schema |            Name            | Type  |    Owner
--------+----------------------------+-------+-------------
 public | auth_group                 | table | user
 public | auth_group_permissions     | table | user
 public | auth_permission            | table | user
 public | auth_user                  | table | user
 public | auth_user_groups           | table | user
 public | auth_user_user_permissions | table | user
 public | django_admin_log           | table | user
 public | django_content_type        | table | user
 public | django_migrations          | table | user
 public | django_session             | table | user
 public | main_app_cat               | table | user    <- Our new table!
(11 rows)

catcollector=#

```

You'll find quite a few tables with names like `django_*`. These tables are used by the framework to track migrations, server-side sessions, etc.

You'll also find several tables with names like `auth_*`. These were created by the `django.contrib.auth` app that's listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` variable within `settings.py`.

You can now quit the shell using: 

```
\q
```
